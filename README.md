# Pok√©dex 2.0

This project was originally a group effort with two of my fellow co-students at the bootcamp. The main purpose was to practice using git commands, manage merges and do pull requests and had fun collaborating on all the tasks and challenges.

We created a react project that displays data from a Pokemon API and allows the user to filter and search the data. 

After the group work was finished I went ahead and created my own copy of our work and enhanced it further by cleaning up the code, changing a few components, writing a custom hook to create a gradual loading effect for better performance and switched from a mobile only to a fully responsive design. 

If you're intereseted in the initial result from the group have a look here: https://github.com/veronicamayer/pokedex_projekt_tag57
